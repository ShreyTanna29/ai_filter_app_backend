# Connection Pool Exhaustion Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing connection pool timeouts with the error:

```
Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool
(Current connection pool timeout: 10, connection limit: 1)
```

This caused the page to become unresponsive.

## Root Cause

1. **Multiple PrismaClient instances**: Each file was creating its own `new PrismaClient()`, exhausting the limited connection pool
2. **Connection limit too low**: DATABASE_URL had `connection_limit=1` which is insufficient for concurrent requests

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Shared Prisma Client (`src/lib/prisma.ts`)

- Single shared PrismaClient instance used across the entire application
- Prevents connection pool exhaustion
- Uses singleton pattern with global caching in development

### 2. Updated All Files to Use Shared Instance

- `src/index.ts` ✅
- `src/routes/filter_endpoints.ts` ✅ (removed 4 duplicate instances)
- `src/routes/templates.ts` ✅
- `src/routes/generate-video.ts` ✅
- `src/routes/simple-auth.ts` ✅
- `src/routes/categories.ts` ✅
- `scripts/seed-admin.ts` ✅
- `scripts/seed-templates.ts` ✅

### 3. Increased Database Connection Pool Settings

Updated `.env` file:

```
Before: connection_limit=1
After:  connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20
```

## Files Changed

1. `src/lib/prisma.ts` - NEW shared Prisma client
2. `src/index.ts` - Updated import
3. `src/routes/filter_endpoints.ts` - Removed 4 duplicate instances
4. `src/routes/templates.ts` - Updated import
5. `src/routes/generate-video.ts` - Updated import
6. `src/routes/simple-auth.ts` - Updated import
7. `src/routes/categories.ts` - Updated import
8. `scripts/seed-admin.ts` - Updated import
9. `scripts/seed-templates.ts` - Updated import
10. `.env` - Increased connection_limit from 1 to 10

## Result

- ✅ Single PrismaClient instance shared across the app
- ✅ Connection pool increased from 1 to 10 connections
- ✅ Pool timeout increased to 20 seconds
- ✅ No more connection exhaustion errors
- ✅ Page responsiveness restored

## How It Works

```typescript
// Before (BAD - creates new instance each time)
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma";
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// After (GOOD - uses shared instance)
import prisma from "./lib/prisma";
```

The shared prisma instance is created once and reused, preventing connection pool exhaustion.
